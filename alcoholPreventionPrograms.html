                <h2>Let's #MentionPrevention</h2>
                <p>Let's #MentionPrevention is a grassroots substance use prevention, education and awareness campaign with the mission of strengthening Connecticut communities through the power of communication.
                    This campaign was created by local coalitions to address the timely substance use-related issues that their communities face. Presently, the focus of the campaign is to address the health risks associated with alcohol use, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                <h3>Merchants, help us curb underage drinking!</h3>
                <p>
                    Fairfield CARES is looking to partner with our local restaurants, breweries and liquor establishments to help #MentionPrevention when offering to-go alcohol purchases in store, curbside, or delivery.
                    The campaign consists of an onsite retailer poster designed to remind staff about the importance of ID checks and keeping alcohol away from minors in this challenging time. It includes important tips when carding those who are wearing masks, especially if you don’t have an ID scanner at your establishment.
                    Even more importantly we ask the establishments to include our customer insert card in any and all sales of to go alcohol purchases. This customer facing piece contains important information for those who make the purchase reminding them about the dangers of underage drinking and alcohol access for minors.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Onsite Retailer Poster</strong> Hang it in the backroom or any area where employees who will be handling to-go purchases will be situated.

                <h2>Support of Fairfield Police</h2>
                <p>Through Fairfield CARES’ Drug Free Communities Grant, the coalition provides
                    funding to the police department for extra patrols during high school prom and
                    graduation time, and support for their compliance checks to be sure alcohol
                    retailers do not sell to minors.</p>
                <h2>Bringing Programs to Schools and Parents</h2>
                <p>Fairfield CARES brings programs to schools and to parents. Most recently, Mike DeLeon
                    of Steered Straight presented to the students at Fairfield’s public high schools on the
                    consequences of alcohol use before the age of 21. He also educated students on the
                    realities of cannabis and nicotine use. Mike also presented to teachers and to parents.</p>
