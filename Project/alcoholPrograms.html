            <h2>Let's #MentionPrevention</h2>
                <p>Let's #MentionPrevention is a grassroots substance use prevention, education and awareness campaign with the mission of
                    strengthening Connecticut communities through the power of communication.<br>
                    This campaign was created by local coalitions to address the timely substance use-related issues that their communities 
                    face. Presently, the focus of the campaign is to address the health risks associated with alcohol use, especially during 
                    the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                <h3>Merchants, help us curb Underage Drinking!</h3>
                    <p>Fairfield CARES is looking to partner with our local restaurants, breweries and liquor establishments to help #MentionPrevention 
                        when offering to-go alcohol purchases in store, curbside, or delivery.<br>
                        The campaign consists of an onsite retailer poster designed to remind staff about the importance of ID checks and keeping 
                        alcohol away from minors in this challenging time. It includes important tips when carding those who are wearing masks, 
                        especially if you donâ€™t have an ID scanner at your establishment.<br>
                        Even more importantly we ask the establishments to include our customer insert card in any and all sales of to go alcohol 
                        purchases. This customer facing piece contains important information for those who make the purchase reminding them about the 
                        dangers of underage drinking and alcohol access for minors.</p>
