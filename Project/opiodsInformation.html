            Opioid Epidemic
The United States is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic. This page has been created to bring awareness to this issue and to provide preventative steps to reduce the risk of you or a loved one from becoming addicted to opioids. In addition, this page was created to demonstrate that is an issue is prevalent no matter where you live, whether that is in a city, rural area, or suburb like the Town of Fairfield. 

It is important to understand that many opioid addictions and opioid related deaths started with a prescription to deal with pain related to a sports injury, medical procedures or a chronic issue. Those taking the prescription then become addicted. Once they no longer have access to prescribed medications, or can't afford the legally acquired prescription medications, they turn to more affordable and readily available illegal options such as heroin, fentanyl, or other similar opioids. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2 out of every 3 drug overdoses involve opioids. 

Different Opioids
Prescription opioids - prescribed by doctors to treat moderate to severe pain, but can also have serious risks and side effects. Common types of prescription opioids include: oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), morphine, and methadone.

Fentanyl - a synthetic opioid pain reliever. It 50-100 times more potent than opioids like morphine and is approved for treating severe pain, typically advanced cancer pain. Illegally made and distributed, fentanyl has been on the rise in several states including Connecticut. 

Heroin - an illegal opioid. Heroin usage has increased across the US among men and women, most age groups, and people of all income levels.

What can you do to prevent opioid addition or opioid related death?
If you have any opioid medications at home - Count it, Lock it, Drop it. Count the numbers of tablets/pills you have, make sure they are in a locked cabinet, and drop off or discard any unused opioid medications (see directions below).

If you have someone in your household that has an opioid addiction problem, consider getting trained on how to administer Narcan and having it available in your home. Learn more about Narcan and possible training below. In addition, visit the States new free app, NORA, by typing in norasaves.com through the web browser on your smartphone or device. This app educates residents on how to administer Narcan during an overdose.The NORA app also gives GPS location to users in order to locate the closest site where they will be able to obtain the medication Narcan. 

Before accepting a prescription for opioids for yourself or your children, talk to your doctor or dentist about alternatives to opioids for dealing with pain. This is especially important if you or anyone who regularly enters your home has had any addiction problems.

Get involved in state or local groups or organizations working to prevent opioid addictions such as Fairfield CARES.

What is Narcan?
Narcan also known as Naloxone, is a medication that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose. 

In Fairfield, all first responders including Police, Fire, and EMT have been trained in Narcan and carry it. Additionally, all school nurses in the district have also been trained and have it available to them.  Residents can purchase Narcan at local pharmacies.

How to Properly Dispose of Opioid Medications
One of the most important ways to help prevent the misuse of opioids is to properly dispose of any unused prescription opioid medication.

The Fairfield Police Department has a medication drop box. Individuals can simply drop prescription and over-the-counter medications no questions asked and no information given to Police. This drop box can be found:

At Police headquarters at 100 Reef Road, Fairfield, in the front lobby

Please bring medications in original containers with the label removed. For more information on medications that are accepted or not accepted at the drug drop box please visit this website. Here is a list of all locked drug boxes in the Greater Bridgeport area.

For additional information as to how to dispose of medication, please view the Fairfield Health Department's video demonstrating how to dispose of medications properly.
